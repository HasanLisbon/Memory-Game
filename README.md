## How to play

To play the game you just need to click on any card on the deck and it will automatically start the timer and each 2 clicked card will be counted as 1 move. The game rating will be based on the number of move you make.

## Score

The score benchmark is like that if you can match all the cards within 17 moves then you get 3 stars, if within 24 moves you get you get 2 star, if within 32 moves you get 1 star and more than that you loose all stars.

## Reset

To reset the game just click on the restart icon which will reset the time and stars and moves.

## Game Over

When all the cards are matched the game is over and you get a pop up window with score and a button if you want to play again or not.
